How to safely create GitHub issues from a shell (using the `gh` CLI)

Problem
- Passing a multiline body directly on the command line can easily cause the shell to enter an interactive quoting mode (e.g., dquote>), or break due to unescaped quotes and newlines.

Best practice
- Write the body to a temporary file and use `gh issue create --body-file <path>`.
- This avoids shell escaping, works reliably in scripts and CI, and is easy to review/edit before sending.

Example (non-interactive, safe):

1) Create a body file:

```bash
cat > /tmp/issue-body.md <<'MD'
This is the issue body.
It can contain 'single' and "double" quotes, backticks `code`, and multiple lines.
MD
```

2) Create the issue using the file:

```bash
gh issue create --repo owner/repo --title "My issue title" --label bug --body-file /tmp/issue-body.md
```

Notes
- Use single-quoted heredocs (<<'MD') when creating the file to avoid variable expansion or unwanted escaping inside the body.
- Alternatively, if you must pass body text directly, escape carefully or use a here-doc with `--body-file - <<'EOF'...EOF` but be mindful of the shell used by the environment running the command.
- In automation, prefer `--body-file` reading from a prepared file stored in the repo or generated by the script.

## November 17, 2025 — other notes
- Jules repeatedly committed runtime artifacts (`uploads/*.png`, `__pycache__/`) to multiple PR branches. These directories must stay out of git; use `.gitignore` and clean the working tree before pushing.
- Please verify new endpoints against `api/openapi.yaml` before opening a PR. The last three PRs diverged from the documented contract, which creates churn for reviewers and testers.

## Safe GH heredoc command for posting long comments

If `gh pr comment` needs a long body and you want to avoid shell quoting issues, use a heredoc (EOF) in zsh/bash like this:

```sh
gh pr comment 18 --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<PASTE YOUR COMMENT HERE>
EOF
 )"
```

This will send the exact contents inside the heredoc to the GitHub CLI as the `--body` value and avoids problems with embedded quotes or special characters.
